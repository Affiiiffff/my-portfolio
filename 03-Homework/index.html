        <h1>Afif Patel</h1>
        <p>In my free time, I busy myself with hands on activities such as tinkering with my motorcycles and cars. I thoroughly enjoy racing motorcycles and enhancing their capabilities be it through aero dynamic modifications or weight reduction.
          My position as Captain during weekend football sessions has been instrumental in honing my decision-making skills under pressure. Through delegating player positions and motivating the team, I have become adept at transformational leadership. Being a competitive individual, football allows me to compete with my friends as well as making it a very sociable activity.
